This project is a sample to send and receive data over UDP (on localhost) using
UDP segmentation:
 - the server sends 10000 bytes in a single `sendmsg()` call using segments of
   1200 bytes;
 - the client correctly receives 9 separate UDP packets for a total of 10000
   bytes (8 packets of 1200 bytes and one of 400 bytes).

It has been written in the context of this [issue] on the [Quinn] project.

## Build & run

```bash
gcc server.c -o server
gcc client.c -o client
```

Start the server and keep it running:

```bash
./server  # interrupt with Ctrl+c to stop it
```

It listens for UDP packets on port 12345.

Execute the client in a separate terminal, it will immediately send the data to
localhost:12345:

```
./client
```

## Expected results

```console
$ ./client
10000 bytes sent (segment_size=1200)
```

```console
$ ./server
Received datagram (1200 bytes)

## Wireshark

More surprisingly, [Wireshark] sees only 1 UDP packet (it does not see
individual packets):
